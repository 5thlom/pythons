Questions:
   1. When is top-down much faster than bottom-up?
      give me an instance where top-down is 5 times faster than bottom-up.
      (you need to provide the input, output, running times, 
      and number of non-zero cells in opt in each of the two approaches).
    Answer: failed to finish bottom-up
    
   2. When is bottom-up much faster than top-down?

   3. Would your top-down or bottom-up work if the weights are float numbers?

    Answer:
    
    top-down is should be fastest when there is only 2 recursion calls, the if statement is failed.


    number of non-zero cells in opt
    bdab
	non-zero cells: 72
	no lcs
	non-zero cells: 0
